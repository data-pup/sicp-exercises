# SICP Exercise 2.3.4

This directory contains work following Chapter 2.3.4 in Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), covering the example of
using Huffman Encoding Trees to represent data.

The code in this directory will be using TypeScript rather than Lisp to
implement solutions to the problem. Some notes will quote sections of the
book, and may display the original Lisp implementation detailed in the book.

## Problem Overview

Let's start with discussing why Huffman Encoding Trees are a valuable
concept to understand for aspiring computer scientists. Huffman coding is
a good example of a nontrivial data abstraction, and is an efficient method for
implementing lossless data compression.
